Read [dlthub documentation for loading data from API](https://dlthub.com/devel/tutorial/load-data-from-an-api). 

> [!NOTE]
> We will only do simple loading from API and won't go through incremental loading and pagination. Also we won't use API which requires a secret in the lecture, but there will be an exercise on it.


## Initalize project 

Run 

```bash
dlt init jobsearch snowflake
```

Fill in `.dlt/secrets.toml`

```toml
[destination.snowflake.credentials]
database = "job_ads" # please set me up!
password = "<your_password>" # please set me up!
username = "<your_username>" # please set me up!
host = "<your_host>" # can be found through 
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH" # please set me up!
role = "ACCOUNTADMIN" # please set me up!
```


## Arbetsförmedlingen

We will be using jobtech API to get ads published in arbetsförmedlingen/platsbanken. Go into [this code examples repository](https://gitlab.com/arbetsformedlingen/job-ads/getting-started-code-examples/code-examples-start-here) to read documentation.
