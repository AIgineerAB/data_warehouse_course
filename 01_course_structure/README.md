## Study tips

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always watch the videos `before` the corresponding class if you are enrolling to this class. Bring questions to class and discuss with your classmates.

> [!TIP]
> Look through the glossary in the exericses before each video, and try to familiarize yourself with the language and the contents.

> [!TIP]
> Watch the videos, pause and rewind when needed so that you can follow along.

> [!TIP]
> Write a lot of code, don't just copy and paste code, type it out and code along the videos. In this way you'll develop muscle memory in programming. Similar goes to when you take code from LLM's, always type it out and see if you also can rewrite the code to fit your needs better.

> [!TIP]
> Skim through the resources, you probably won't have time to read all of the resources. Use it as a reference when needing to deep dive in some concepts.
