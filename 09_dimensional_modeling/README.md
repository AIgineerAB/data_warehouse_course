Read [dlthub documentation for loading data from API](https://dlthub.com/devel/tutorial/load-data-from-an-api). 

> [!NOTE]
> We will only do simple loading from API and won't go through incremental loading and pagination. Also we won't use API which requires a secret in the lecture, but there will be an exercise on it.
