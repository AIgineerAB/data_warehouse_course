Snowsight is the web interface of snowflake. It is a GUI in which you practically can do anything in snowflake. For example you could use snowsight to create and manage 

- database 
- virtual warehouse 
- roles 
- users
- admin
- cost
- sql worksheets

Note also that many of these things can be achieved both with SQL code and with snowsight. We will in many cases use SQL code instead of snowsight to create different objects.
